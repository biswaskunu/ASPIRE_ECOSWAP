🌿 Eco-Swap: The Urban Logistics Layer
Decentralizing Resource Recovery & Ecological Restoration

📌 Project Overview
Ecological restoration often fails because vital resources—organic biomass and non-potable water—are trapped in urban "silos." Without a logistics layer to connect supply with ecological demand, these nutrients become pollutants in landfills and sewers.
Eco-Swap is a circular economy marketplace designed for campuses and urban centers. It digitizes "waste" as a resource asset, allowing users to trade E-waste, biomass, and greywater for Eco-Points, effectively bridging the gap between urban waste and ecological restoration.

🚀 Key Features
Asset Categorization: Intelligent classification of waste into Nutrients (Biomass/Water) and Raw Materials (E-Waste).

Logistics Transparency: Provides weight and location metadata to optimize resource collection.
Gamified Restoration: A "Seedling-to-Forest Keeper" ranking system to incentivize student participation.
Dynamic Resource Feed: A real-time dashboard powered by JavaScript to manage available urban assets.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS (Custom Grid/Flexbox Architecture)
Logic: JavaScript 
Styling: Responsive Design with CSS Variables for theme consistency.
